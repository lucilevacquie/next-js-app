## Notes

- I unfortunatly didn't have time to have all the filters to work. I tried to focus on one of each type (price, brand, on sale).

## Improvements

- Add a loading state to make the filtering UX smoother.
- Add filter functionality for all the facets and find a better way that doesn't require a switch statement.
- Add the wishlist functinality.
- Improve the pagination UI.
- I didn't spend as much time as I usually do on making it accessible (eg. productCard shouldn't be a link, the title of the card should be the link and then I'd use the ::before pseudo element to make the whole card clickable).

## Questions

- The way to fetch the data is unusual: I don't understand why I use POST method when I'm not creating new data. I'd be interested to hear more about it!
